*** XML Files In Root Directory ***
The XML files in the root of this folder are a conversion of the MusicXML files in ../MsicXMLv1.   They were imported into Siblius 7 and then exported as XML 3. 

*** xmlsamples ***
The folder xmlsamples contains a set of MusicXML 3 files obtained from the following site on 5 September 2015:

http://www.musicxml.com/music-in-musicxml/example-set/

The description on that page says:

“All the sample files on this page have now been updated to the MusicXML 3.0 format as exported from Finale 2011, using the Dolet 6 for Finale plug-in. The files were then hand-edited as needed to illustrate features that are not automatically generated by the export software.”
