\brief Represents time signatures.

	Time signatures are represented by two elements. The
	beats element indicates the number of beats, as found in
	the numerator of a time signature. The beat-type element
	indicates the beat unit, as found in the denominator of
	a time signature. The symbol attribute is used to
	indicate another notation beyond a fraction: the common
	and cut time symbols, as well as a single number with an
	implied denominator. Normal (a fraction) is the implied
	symbol type if none is specified. Multiple pairs of
	beat and beat-type elements are used for composite
	time signatures with multiple denominators, such as
	2/4 + 3/8. A composite such as 3+2/8 requires only one
	beat/beat-type pair. A senza-misura element explicitly
	indicates that no time signature is present.
\n
    The MusicXML \e time element is defined in attributes.dtd.
