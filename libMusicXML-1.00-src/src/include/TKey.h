\brief Represents a key signature.

	Traditional key signatures are represented by the number
	of flats and sharps, plus an optional mode for major/
	minor/mode distinctions. Negative numbers are used for
	flats and positive numbers for sharps, reflecting the
	key's placement within the circle of fifths (hence the
	element name). A cancel element indicates that the old
	key signature should be cancelled before the new one
	appears. This will always happen when changing to C major
	or A minor and need not be specified then. The cancel
	value matches the fifths value of the cancelled key
	signature (e.g., a cancel of -2 will provide an explicit
	cancellation for changing from B flat major to F major).
\n	
	Non-traditional key signatures can be represented using
	the Humdrum/Scot concept of a list of altered tones.
	The key-step and key-alter elements are represented the
	same way as the step and alter elements are in the pitch
	element in note.dtd. The different element names indicate
	the different meaning of altering notes in a scale versus
	altering a sounding pitch.
\n	
	Valid mode values include major, minor, dorian, phrygian,
	lydian, mixolydian, aeolian, ionian, and locrian.
\n
	TKey corresponds to the MusicXML \e key element as defined 
	in attributes.dtd.
