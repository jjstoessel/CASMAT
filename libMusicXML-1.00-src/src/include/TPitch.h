\brief The MusicXML representation of the pitch.

	Pitch is represented as a combination of the step of the
	diatonic scale, the chromatic alteration, and the octave.
	The step element uses the English letters A through G:
	in a future revision, this could expand to international
	namings. The alter element represents chromatic 
	alteration in number of semitones (e.g., -1 for flat,
	1 for sharp). Decimal values like 0.5 (quarter tone
	sharp) may be used for microtones. The octave element
	is represented by the numbers 0 to 9, where 4 indicates
	the octave started by middle C.
\n
    The MusicXML \e pitch element is defined in note.dtd.

\brief The MusicXML representation of an unpitched note.

	The unpitched element indicates musical elements that are
	notated on the staff but lack definite pitch, such as
	unpitched percussion and speaking voice. Like notes, it
	uses step and octave elements to indicate placement on
	the staff, following the current clef. If percussion clef
	is used, the display-step and display-octave are
	interpreted as if in treble clef, with a G in octave 4 
	on line 2. If not present, the note is placed on the 
	middle line of the staff, generally used for one-line
	staffs.
