\brief Identifies the different musical parts in a movement. 
	
	There must be at least one score-part, combined as
	desired with part-group elements that indicate braces
	and brackets. Parts are ordered from top to bottom in
	a score based on the order in which they appear in the
	part-list.
\n
	TPartList corresponds to the MusicXML \e part-list element 
	as defined in score.dtd.
