/*!
\brief used for transposing instruments.

	If the part is being encoded for a transposing instrument
	in written vs. concert pitch, the transposition must be
	encoded in the transpose element. The transposition is
	represented by chromatic steps (required) and three
	optional elements: diatonic pitch steps, octave changes,
	and doubling an octave down. The chromatic and
	octave-change elements are numeric values added to the
	encoded pitch data to create the sounding pitch. The
	diatonic element is also numeric and allows for correct
	spelling of enharmonic transpositions.
\n
    The MusicXML \e transpose element is defined in attributes.dtd.
