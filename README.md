CASMAT - Computer-Assisted Symbolic Musical Analysis Toolbox
=======
Brief History
-------
CASMAT is a collection of C++ tools for the symbolic analysis of encoded music notation. It was previously known as "CAnonic Techniques Symbolic Music Analysis Toolbox" (CATSMAT) but has since abandon that name as the toolbox continues to evolve a series of additional capabilities for the analysis of other compositional processes and styles. Its original codebase dates back to 2006 where it it was developed by Jason Stoessel for a University of New England funded project examining intertextuality in 15th-century music, led by former Senior Lecturer, Dr Rex Eakins. The next major phase of development occurred between 2015 and 2017 when the original codebase was expanded to a set of tools for the analysis of canonic techniques in medieval and early modern music. Development in this phase was supported by funding from the Australian Research Council for a three-year Discovery Project, "Canon techniques and musical change, c.1330â€“c.1530" (DP150102135). Mr Derrick Hill provided major contributions to the toolbox as the project's programmer under the supervision of Chief Investigator Stoessel, who also contributed additional code. The toolbox has continued to evolve in a second Australian Research Council Discovery Project, "The Art and Science of Canon in the Music of Early 17th-Century Rome" (DP180100680) with code contributions by Chief Investigator Stoessel.

This version of CASMAT was released as is on 18 March 2020.
